# SQL-Projects
Welcome to my repository of SQL projects that I have completed over the course of my Masters and on my own time.
My first project, the Art Museum Database, is a project I built with my team in the first term of my Masters program. This project was very personal to me, as I am an avid art aficionado and even had my first real internship in an Art Museum at UC Berkeley. It has always been my dream to be an art museum curator - so this fantasy museum, with 100 art pieces from the 100 most influential artists throughout history, was like living out my lifelong dream! More importantly, it shows an awesome demonstration and many SQL queries to pull, gather, and analyze data across the database. This assisted us with creating exhibits for artworks with shared genres and time periods, auctioning artwork, and determining commonalities among different pieces across time. I hope you enjoy taking a look!
